## Overview  
<hr>  
Brief analysis of kickstarter campaigns that were also analyzed with pandas  

<br>

*  Tableau

## Data Source  

The origins are unknown. The type of data matches what is on Kickstarter.com but 4,200 records is very small considering current campaigns (500,000 in 2022). A validated dataset should be obtained for a more serious analysis.  

<br>
